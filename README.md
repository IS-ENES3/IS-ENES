## Welcome to the IS-ENES3 project on GitHub
### Infrastructure for the European Network for Earth System Modelling (2019 - 2022)

IS-ENES3, an Horizon 2020 project, is the third phase of the distributed e-infrastructure of the European Network for Earth System Modelling ([ENES](https://portal.enes.org/)).

The community aims to develop a better understanding of past and present-day climate and to project future variability and changes through the development and sharing of model components, modelling tools and data infrastructure.
